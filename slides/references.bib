	abstract = {The integration of social science with computer science and engineering fields has produced a new area of study: computational social science. This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital data such as social media, administrative records, and historical archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: ( a) social network analysis and group formation; ( b) collective behavior and political sociology; ( c) the sociology of knowledge; ( d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; ( e) the production of culture; ( f) economic sociology and organizations; and ( g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.},

	abstract = {This study examines the growing journalistic practice of embedding full tweets in political online news coverage. Against the background of a hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to the overall news coverage. Second, we examine the functions of embedded tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood that tweets are selected for publication in a news article. We combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine journalistic practice at a modest level. In the majority of news articles, tweets function as an illustration of an argument or information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and – with some dependencies – the amount of popularity cues increased the likelihood of a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper provides evidence how transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest themselves in reporting.}

	abstract = {We introduce the rationale for a new peer-reviewed scholarly journal, theJournal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media. The journal is intendedto create a new venue for research on digital media and address severaldeficiencies in the current social science publishing landscape. First,descriptive research is undersupplied and undervalued. Second, researchquestions too often only reflect dominant theories and received wisdom.Third, journals are constrained by unnecessary boundaries defined bydiscipline, geography, and length. Fourth, peer review is inefficient andunnecessarily burdensome for both referees and authors. We outline thejournal’s scope and structure, which is open access, fee-free and relies on aLetter of Inquiry (LOI) model. Quantitative description can appeal to socialscientists of all stripes and is a crucial methodology for understanding thecontinuing evolution of digital media and its relationship to importantquestions of interest to social scientists.},
